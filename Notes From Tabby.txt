The main files needed to be configured as a mandatory are:

I am deeply concerned for my repository's wellbeing right now.

// Files that store meta info about the mod (keep mod version updated):
- build.gradle
- src/main/resources/META-INF/mods.toml

// Basic tasks to operate the dev environment:
- Tasks/forgegradle runs/<genIntellijRuns> //must be run once on env. setup
- Tasks/build/<build>
- Tasks/forgegradle runs/<runClient>

// Code source path:
- src/main/java/...

// Build modification path:
- build/libs/...

// Temp Minecraft installation:
- run/...

// IF THERE IS ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR OF INTEREST IN THE VANILLA MINECRAFT ASSETS, they are here:
- (External Libraries) /Gradle: net.minecraft:client:extra:1.19.2/...
